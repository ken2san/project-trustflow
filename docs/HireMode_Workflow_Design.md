# Hire Mode Workflow: Detailed Design & Implementation Plan

## 1. Delivery & Approval Flow Design

### Step Structure

1. **Escrow Start**
   - UI: Display "Escrow funds locked"
   - Action: Progress bar, next action is "Awaiting Delivery"

2. **Awaiting Delivery**
   - UI: Clearly indicate "Awaiting Delivery"; show "Not Submitted" badge if no file
   - When file is submitted:
     - Show "Download" button (with version/timestamp)
     - Show "Delivery Message"
   - Action: Enable "Approve" or "Reject" buttons only after "Reviewed" checkbox is checked

3. **On Reject**
   - UI: Require input of rejection reason, automatically send re-delivery request
   - History: Add "Reject" action, reason, and timestamp to history
   - On re-delivery, show as "Version 2" etc. in history

4. **On Approval**
   - UI: Show confirmation dialog when "Approve" is clicked
   - After approval, move to "Rating" step

5. **Rating & Completion**
   - UI: Input rating (stars + comment), then show "Contract Complete" screen
   - History: Display all interactions, files, and actions in chronological order

## 2. Implementation Plan

### A. State Management

- `contractStep` (enum: ESCROW, WAIT_DELIVERABLE, REVIEW, REJECTED, RATING, COMPLETE)
- `deliverables` (array: {version, fileUrl, message, timestamp})
- `reviewStatus` (enum: PENDING, APPROVED, REJECTED, NEEDS_REVISION)
- `history` (array: {type, message, timestamp, actor})

### B. UI/UX

- Clearly display state at each step (progress bar, badges, explanatory text)
- When file is submitted: show "Download", "Preview", and "Version History"
- "Approve" and "Reject" buttons are enabled only after "Reviewed" checkbox is checked
- On reject: require reason input, show re-delivery request UI
- Show all actions, comments, and files in a chronological history panel
- For critical actions, show confirmation dialog and allow Undo (e.g., 5 seconds to cancel)

### C. Backend/Data

- File uploads stored in storage (e.g., Firebase Storage) with hash recorded
- All actions, comments, and files saved in DB with timestamp
- On dispute, automatically aggregate all history/files and send to admin/arbitrator

### D. Notifications & Communication

- Automatic notifications (email/in-app/chat) on delivery, reject, re-delivery, approval
- Chat history integrated with contract history

## 3. Implementation Priority & Roadmap Example

1. **File delivery & version management**
2. **Reject → re-delivery flow (reason input, re-delivery request)**
3. **Progress & history panel implementation**
4. **Confirmation dialog & Undo for approval/reject**
5. **Automatic evidence aggregation & admin notification on dispute**
6. **UI/UX fine-tuning (explanations, badges, responsive design, etc.)**

By following this design and implementation plan,
you can achieve high standards for evidence, transparency, immediacy, prevention of misoperation, and automatic escalation in case of trouble.
