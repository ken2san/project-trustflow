// src/lib/auditExport.js
// Signed audit trail export — produce a self-contained JSON document
// that proves a contract's immutable event history.
//
// The exported document contains:
//   - Contract metadata + DoD hash
//   - Full event chain with per-event SHA-256 hashes and RFC 3161 TSA tokens
//   - A chain integrity report: each event's hash is re-verified AND its
//     prev_event_hash is checked against its chronological predecessor's
//     actual hash. The prev_hash link (not just each event's own hash) is
//     what lets a deleted, reordered, or forged-and-inserted event be
//     detected — a lone self-consistent hash on an isolated row proves
//     nothing about whether the row belongs where it claims to be in the
//     sequence. See eventLog.js's logEvent() for how the chain is built.
//   - Export metadata (generated_at, generator version)
//
// Anyone can verify by re-computing the hashes (including each event's
// prev_hash) and comparing against on-chain anchors or TSA tokens without
// access to TrustFlow servers.
