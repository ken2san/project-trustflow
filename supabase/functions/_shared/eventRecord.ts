// supabase/functions/_shared/eventRecord.ts
//
// How a stored event is assembled — the companion to eventCanonical.ts, which
// defines only what the hash covers.
//
// Two Edge Functions now write events: log-event, for assertions a party makes
// during a transaction, and validate-invite-token, for the acceptance that
// begins one. The acceptance had to move there because acceptance and its
// evidence must commit together, and only that function owns the invitation.
//
// Both go through this module rather than each building a row of their own.
// The single production bug this chain has had came from two implementations of
// the same rule drifting apart, and "what an event records" is exactly such a
// rule: an acceptance written by one path and an assertion written by the other
// must be the same kind of object, or a verifier has to know which produced it.

 *
 * Note on naming: the owning account is still called 'earner' and the
